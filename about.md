# About me

I am a bioinformatician with some 
experience in commercial consultancy, who has moved on to pursue a PhD in
[Catalina Vallejos' group](https://vallejosgroup.github.io/) in the 
[MRC Human Genetics Unit](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit) based in the 
[Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine](https://www.ed.ac.uk/igmm)
(University of Edinburgh). My research project relates to Bayesian analysis
of single cell RNA sequencing, expanding on the excellent work done already
by Catalina as well as Nils Eling and others in the EBI and beyond.

I am also interested in the R programming language and data visualisation,
and have made contributions to a number of R packages, in particular those
relating to genomic visualisations and interactive graphics. My consultancy
work was done with [Fios Genomics](https://www.fiosgenomics.com/), and I was
lucky enough in that position to be able to develop my programming, 
data analysis and visualisation, and presentation skills.

Thanks for visiting my personal website. 
Please get in touch if you have any questions.
