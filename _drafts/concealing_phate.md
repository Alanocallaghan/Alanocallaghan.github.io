I'd like to relate in some detail some brief insights I gained while preparing 
a presentation for EuroBioc2020.
Since I like puns, this is told using quotes and section 
headings based on titles from the 2010 EP
"Concealing Fate" by the British progressive metal band Tesseract 
(which is highly recommended).



# Origin

> I became so sick of it all

Because my research at the moment involves some focus on transcriptional
heterogeneity in scRNAseq data, with the authors' permission 
I implemented a wrapper R package, 
[densvis](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/densvis.html).
Along with
[snifter](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/snifter.html).

While preparing slides, I decided to review the paper, and because I am talented
at nothing if not procrastination, decided to take a look at the twitter
discussion threads to see if there were any interesting points or examples
that I could include.

# Deception

> *How refined an encounter*

In the various RTs and threads about the preprint from when it was posted back 
in May, I found some interesting discussion involving the author and some 
experts on non-linear dimensionality reduction methods. Given that I am not an
expert in anything but particularly not in these methods, I was excited!

However, after reviewing the thread I was... disappointed. The thread opens with
a group leader implying that this work (quite positively received by others
in the field) was pointless.

# The Impossible

<!-- "Don't you think it's been long enough?" -->
> Open your mind before the impossible consumes us all

I will gladly admit some bias in that I am a mediocre PhD student who is 
currently doing research that may well be pointless. However it seems to me that
this is not a very kind or polite way to enter a discussion of someone's 
work. 

"What's the point? Use mine instead" is not a useful contribution to a discussion
of the method but rather a wholesale dismissal of its practical utility 
and the knowledge or wisdom of those who undertook it 
(given they failed to recognise its futility).



# Epiphany




# Acceptance

> To me it seems you advertised


# Perfection

> Show me your compassion



> I finally found out that this whole world's a lie.
