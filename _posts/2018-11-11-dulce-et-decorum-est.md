# Dulce Et Decorum Est

I feel it is appropriate for the first post on a personal site to be a 
personal one. Today is Remembrance Day, and the 100<sup>th</sup> anniversary of 
the end of the first world war. On my way about my business 
I passed by a large crowd of people gathered for a commemoration ceremony. 
It is difficult for me in times of conflict to reconcile the rightful honouring
of the dead with the way that the nation in which I live (the UK)
and others act to create new victims
of war. The UK's participation in unlawful war, 
advertisement of military service to youth, and sale of arms to totalitarian 
regimes unfortunately taint the remembrance of the millions who 
suffered immensely, and who for the largest part felt they had no choice but to 
participate -- [though some 16,000 conscientous objectors
refused to take part](https://owlcation.com/humanities/Conscientious-Objectors-During-World-War-1).
Edinburgh, as a large British city, contains a huge number of 
war memorials. We should also honour those who refused to participate in this 
senseless killing, as 
[several local groups are seeking to do](https://chuffed.org/project/opposing-war-memorial).
I look forward to the day in which those whose morals compel them to take a 
stand are given the reverence and respect that they deserve.

World War I brings to mind a few great pieces of art produced in protest and 
marvel of the futility of that war, and of war in general. The first is by the 
great Eric Bogle, once a Scot, but now an adopted Australian; the song "No Man's 
Land" (often referred to as "The Green Fields of France")
vividly describes the futility and loss that inevitably follows war.

The second is the poem *Dulce et Decorum est* by Wilfred Owen. This is one of
most affecting pieces of literature I have ever read, and it rarely fails
to strike me deeply. I will not reproduce the poem in its entirety here, 
but in the light of today's commemoration ceremonies, and in light of the 
futility of the "great war" in bringing peace to Europe, the final lines are
as pertinent as ever.

> My friend, you would not tell with such high zest  
To children ardent for some desperate glory,  
The old Lie: Dulce et decorum est  
Pro patria mori.
